# DLITHE_INTERNSHIP_FILES
All my internship day wise practiced files and assignments are added here

SUMMARY OF MY PROJECT:

from DAY-1 TO DAY-15 i have learnt most of PYTHON basics, numpy and pandas libraries ,Basics of DataScience(how to deal with data,how to analyze data,how to get future predictions from given data, how to calculate R2score).
And Below are some of the projects i have worked on...

PROJECT-1)FISH_WEIGHT_PREDICTION:--

          I have downleded the dataset(fish.csv) from kaggale, analyzed the data given and used matplot and seaborn libraries to visualize             data .
          As there are some outliers present in the data i have dropped it and found weight prediction with 0.947 accuracy using linear                 regression algorithm.
          
PROJECT-2)STOCK_PREDICTION:--

          Downloaded the dataset(prices-split-adjusted.csv) from kaggale ,analyzed the data and used matplot and seaborn libraries to                   visualize data 
          As there are no nulls present in the data ,no need of cleaning data and continued the prediction solving using linear regression             with 0.999 accuracy.
          
PROJECT-3)CAR_PRICE_PREDICTION:--

          Downloaded the dataset('car data.csv') from kaggale and analyzed the data and used matplot and seaborn libraries to visualize data.
          As there are no nulls present in the data ,no need of cleaning data and continued the prediction solving using linear regression             with 0.8 accuracy.
